# web-tests

The site's tests (the directory on real SQLite with the migrations applied, the session secret, Liveblocks not connected and connected, the health route, the Worker-secrets push), run on every pull request

The test suite for **web**. It deploys nothing: its lane installs, builds and runs the tests.
